Web application to display and edit songs with lyrics and chords.

**Note that this application is still at an early stage of development and many features are either missing or not working as expected.**

## Demo

A _static_ _development_ version of the application is available at https://musicociel.github.io/musicociel/

As it is a _static_ version, it only shows part of the features of the application. Especially, it does not include any of the features that require the server part.

As it is a _development_ version, it is unstable. It is automatically deployed when the _main_ branch of this repository is updated.

## Installation

Musicociel is published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/musicociel), [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/davdiv/musicociel/) and has a [helm repository](https://musicociel.github.io/musicociel/helm/).
