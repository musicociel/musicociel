.D                        G      D                           A
 What a friend we have in Jesus, All ours sins and griefs to bear;
.D                   G      A                    D
 What a privilege to carry, Everything to God in prayer!
.A                     D        G      D                A
 O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear;
.D                     G      A                    D
 All because we do not carry, Everything to God in prayer!

[V2]
.D                      G        D                   A
 Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?
.D                     G         A                      D
 We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer.
.A                       D         G        D               A
 Can we find a friend so faithful? Who will all our sorrows share?
.D                     G         A                      D
 Jesus knows our every weakness; Take it to the Lord in prayer.

[V3]
.D                     G      D                       A
 Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care?
.D                          G       A                      D
 Precious Saviour still our refuge; Take it to the Lord in prayer.
.A                         D          G       D              A
 Do thy friends despise forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer!
.D                          G            A                       D
 In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.</lyrics></song>
