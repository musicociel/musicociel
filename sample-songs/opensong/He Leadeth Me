.      D             D/F# G                   D                           A
1He    leadeth me!   O    blessed thought! O  words with heavenly comfort fraught!
2Lord, I would clasp Thy  hand in mine, Nor   ever murmur nor re__________pine,
3And   when my task on    earth is done, When by Thy grace the victory's  won,

.     D                 D/F#  G                    D           Bm        D  A    D
1What_e'er I do,        where'er I be, Still       'tis God's  hand that leadeth me.
2Con__tent, what________ever  lot I see, Since     God through Jordan    leadeth me.
3E'en death's cold wave I     will not flee, Since God through Jordan    leadeth me.

[C]

 He leadeth me, He leadeth me; By His own hand He leadeth me:
.    D        A        D G     D       Bm     D       A       D
 His faithful follower I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me.</lyrics></song>
