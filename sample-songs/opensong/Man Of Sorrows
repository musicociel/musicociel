1Man of Sorrows,    what a   name! For the  Son of     God, Who came
2Bearing shame and  scoffing rude, In my    place con__demned He stood;
3Guilty, vile, and  helpless we;   Spotless Lamb of    God was He;
4Lifted up was      He to    die;  "It is   finished!" was His cry;
5When He comes, our glorious King, All His  ransomed   home to bring,

1Ruined sinners   to re______claim. Hallelujah! What a Savior!
2Sealed my pardon with His   blood. Hallelujah! What a Savior!
3Full atonement!  Can it     be? Hallelu___jah! What a Savior!
4Now in heaven ex_alted      high. Hallelu_jah! What a Savior!
5Then anew His    song weâ€™ll sing: Hallelu_jah! What a Savior!</lyrics></song>
