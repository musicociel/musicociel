.G
1I am so glad that our Father in heaven
2Tho' I forget Him and wander away,
3O if there's only one song I can sing
.D7                        C       D7    G
1Tells of His love in the  Book He has   given.
2Still He doth love me wherever    I     stray.
3When in His beauty I      see the great King,
.G
1Wonderful things in my Bible I see-
2Back to His dear, loving arms would I flee
3This shall my song in eternity be:
.D7                        C     D7    G
1This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
2When I remember that      Jesus loves me.
3"O what a wonder, that    Jesus loves me!"
