.Bb              F          Eb          Bb            Gm        Bb       Eb F Bb
1A mighty        fortress   is our      God, a        Bulwark   never    fa_i_ling;
2Did we in       our own    strength confide, our     striving  would be lo___sing;
3And though this world with devils      filled should threaten  to un____do   us;
4That Word a_____bove all   earthly     pow'r, no     thanks to them a___bid__eth;

.Bb           F         Eb        Bb           Gm       Bb        Eb F    Bb
1Our Helper   He a______mid the   flood of     mortal   ills pre__va_i____ling;
2Were not the right Man on our    side, the    Man of   God's own choo____sing;
3We will not  fear for  God hath  willed His   truth to triumph   through us:
4The Spirit   and the   gifts are ours through Him who  with us   si______deth;

.    Gm        Csus C     F          Bb      Eb      Gm
1For still our an___cient Foe doth   seek to work us woe;
2Dost ask who  that may   be: Christ Jesus   it is   He;
3The prince of dark_ness  grim, we   tremble not for him;
4Let goods and kin__dred  go, this   mortal  life al_so;

.     Gm        Csus  C   F           Gm         Cm      D
1His  craft and pow'r are great, and  armed with cruel   hate,
2Lord Sabba_____oth   His name, from  age to     age the same,
3His  rage we   can   en__dure for    lo, his    doom is sure,
4The  body      they  may kill; God's truth a____bideth  still,

.    Gm       Bb         Eb F Bb
1On  earth is not his    e____qual.
2And He must  win the    bat__tle.
3One little   word shall fell him.
4His kingdom  is for_____e____ver!</lyrics></song>
