  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                                E7                     A
 Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, Sing His mercy and His grace;
.A               D                   A        E7            A
 In the mansions bright and blessed, He'll prepare for us a place.

[C]
.        A                                  B7                E7
 When we all get to heaven, What a day of rejoicing that will be;
.        A       D            A        E7             A
 When we all see Jesus, We'll sing and shout the victory.

[V2]
.A                                  E7                          A
 While we walk the pilgrim pathway, Clouds will over spread the sky;
.A                   D              A     E7            A
 But when travelling days are over, Not a shadow, not a sigh.

[V3]
.A                                 E7                    A
 Let us then be true and faithful, Trusting serving everyday;
.A                   D             A        E7              A
 Just one glimpse of Him in glory, Will the toils of life repay.

[V4]
.A                              E7                      A
 Onward to the prize before us, Soon His beauty we'll behold;
.A               D                A        E7                   A
 Soon the pearly gates will open, We shall tread the streets of gold.</lyrics></song>
