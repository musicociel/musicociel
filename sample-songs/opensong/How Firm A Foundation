1How   firm    a foun___dation, ye   saints of the Lord,
2"Fear not,    I am     with thee, O be not dis____mayed,
3"When through the deep waters I     call thee to  go,
4"When through fiery    trials thy   pathway shall lie,
5"The  soul    that on  Jesus hath   leaned for re_pose,

.    G      C        G     Em          G/D   D7        G
1Is  laid   for your faith in His      ex____cellent   word!
2For I      am your  God,  and will    still give thee aid;
3The ri_____vers of  sor___row shall   not   over______flow;
4My  grace, all suf__fi____cient shall be    thy sup___ply;
5I   will   not, I   will  not de______sert  to his    foes;

1What more can He      say than to    you He hath   said,
2I'll strengthen thee, help thee and  cause thee to stand,
3For I will be         with thee, thy troubles to   bless,
4The flame shall not   hurt thee; I   only de_______sign
5That soul, though all hell should en_deavor to     shake,

.     G     C       G     Em       G/D  D7       G
1To   you   who for re____fuge to  Je___sus hath fled.
2Up___held  by My   right_eous, om_ni___potent   hand."
3And  sanc__tify    to    thee thy deep_est   distress."
4Thy  dross to con__sume, and thy  gold to re____fine."
5I'll ne____ver, no ne____ver, no  ne___ver for__sake!"</lyrics></song>
