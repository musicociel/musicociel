  <lyrics>[V]
.                  A2                  D
1Oh Lord my        God, when I in      awesome wonder
2When through the  woods, and forest   glades I wander,
3And when I        think that God, His Son not sparing
4When Christ shall come with shout of  acclamation
.             A2         E          Bm         A2
1Consider     all the    worlds Thy hands have made;
2And hear the birds sing sweetly    in the     trees;
3Sent Him to  die, I     scarce can take it    in;
4And take me  home, what joy shall  fill my    heart;
.                             D
1I see the stars, I hear the  rolling thunder:
2When I look down from lofty  mountain grandeur,
3That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
4Then I shall bow in humble   adoration,
.                 A2       E        Bm         A2
1Thy pow'r throughout the  uni______verse dis__played.
2And hear the    brook and feel the gentle     breeze.
3He bled and     died to   take a___way my     sin.
4And there pro___claim my  God how  great Thou art!

[C]
.              A2      D             A2
 Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee,
.               E                   A2
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art;
.                      D             A2
 Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee,
.               E  Bm               A2
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art.</lyrics></song>
