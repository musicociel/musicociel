[V]
.G
1Standing on the promises of Christ, my King!
2Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
3Standing on the promises, I now can see
4Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
5Standing on the promises, I cannot fall,
.C                                    G
1Through eternal ages let His         praises ring;
2When the howling storms of doubt and fears assail,
3Perfect, present cleansing in the    blood for me;
4Bound to Him eternally by            love's strong cord,
5List'ning every moment to the        Spirit's call,
.G
1"Glory in the highest!" I will shout and sing,
2By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
3Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
4Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
5Resting in my Saviour as my All-in-All,
.                Am   D      G
1Standing on the promises of God.
2Standing on the promises of God.
3Standing on the promises of God.
4Standing on the promises of God.
5Standing on the promises of God.
