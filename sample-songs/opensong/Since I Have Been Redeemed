 I have a song I love to sing, since I have been redeemed;

 Of my Redeemer, Savior, King, since I have been redeemed.

 Since I have been redeemed, since I have been redeemed I will glory in His name;
.      D             A              G           A        D
 Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Saviorâ€™s name.

.   D              A       D            G      A      D
 To do His will my highest prize, since I have been redeemed.

 I have a witness bright and clear, since I have been redeemed;

 Dispelling every doubt and fear, since I have been redeemed.

 I have a home prepared for me, since I have been redeemed;
.      D              A     D         G      A      D
 Where I shall dwell eternally, since I have been redeemed.</lyrics></song>
