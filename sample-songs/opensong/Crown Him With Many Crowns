  <lyrics>[V1]
.C              Am   F           Em    F       Gsus    G
 Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne;
.G    C       Am       D      G       C   G     D       G    G7
 Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns, all music but its own;
. C                F        D                G     G7
 Awake my soul and sing, of Him who died for Thee,
.    C        F      Dm7       C            Dm7  G    C
 And hail Him as Thy matchless King through all eternity.

[V2]
.C             Am      F         Em        F        Gsus   G
 Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed oâ€™er the grave;
.G   C       Am      D      G       C   G        D       G     G7
 And rose victorious in the strife, for those He came to save;
.    C              F         D                G     G7
 His glories now we sing, who died and rose on high,
.    C     F      Dm7     C         Dm7        G         C
 Who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die.

[V3]
.C             Am      F       Em       F         Gsus  G
 Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side;
.G    C          Am  D    G     C  G      D    G     G7
 Rich wounds yet visible above, in beauty glorified;
.    C             F         D                  G   G7
 All hail Redeemer hail, for Thou hast died for me,
.    C            F      Dm7   C            Dm7  G    C
 Thy praise shall never, never fail, throughout eternity.</lyrics></song>
