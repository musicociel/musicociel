.     A                      D                     E7                      A
 On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
.      A                             D                       E7                        A
 And I love that old cross where the dearest and best, For a world of lost sinners was slain.

[C]
.        E7                     A
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
.        D                      A
 Till my trophies at last I lay down;
.       A                       D
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,
.      A              E7        A
 And exchange it some day for a crown.

[V2]
.        A                      D                          E7                      A
 Oh that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, Has a wondrous attraction for me;
.        A                         A               E7                   A
 For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above, To bear it to dark Calvary.

[V3]
.       A                              D                  E7                A
 In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, A wondrous beauty I see;
.         A                       D                     E7                  A
 For twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, To pardon and sanctify me.

[V4]
.       A                       D                 E7                        A
 To the old rugged cross I will ever be true, Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
.           A                      D                        E7                 A
 Then He'll call me some day to my home far away, Where his glory forever I'll share.</lyrics></song>
