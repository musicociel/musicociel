  <lyrics>[V1]
.A            E             D        A
 Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
.D           A         B7           E
 There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
.E7            A           A7            D
 Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not;
.Bm7          A             D    E    A
 As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be.

[C]
.E            A             F#           Bm
 Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness!
.E          A           B7        E
 Morning by morning new mercies I see;
.E7         A           A7            D
 All I have needed, Thy hands hath provided--
.B7           A             D      E  A
 Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me!

[V2]
.A          E          D              A
 Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
.D             A              B7       E
 Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
.E7            A         A7       D
 Join with all nature in manifold witness
.Bm7          A             D     E   A
 To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

[V3]
.A          E         D            A
 Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
.D            A           B7           E
 Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
.E7             A              A7         D
 Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
.Bm7           A             D         E A
 Blessings all mine with ten thousands beside.</lyrics></song>
